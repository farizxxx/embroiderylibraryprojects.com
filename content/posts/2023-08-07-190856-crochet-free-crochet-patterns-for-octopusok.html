<p>Crocheting an octopus can also be a fun and rewarding project. You can customize your octopus by using different colors and adding embellishments like bows and hats. Plus, once you finish making your octopus, you can donate it to a NICU or give it as a gift to a friend or family member who is expecting a premature baby.</p>
