<h2>Stitching Your Witchy Design</h2>

<p>Once you've chosen your pattern and gathered your supplies, it's time to start stitching! Here's a quick guide to the basic steps:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Fabric</h3>

<p>If you're using an embroidery hoop, place your fabric inside the hoop and tighten the screw to hold it in place. If you're not using a hoop, simply hold the fabric taut in your non-dominant hand.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Thread Your Needle</h3>

<p>Cut a length of embroidery thread and separate it into individual strands (most patterns will specify how many strands to use for each color). Thread one of the strands through the eye of your embroidery needle.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Begin Stitching</h3>

<p>Consult your pattern to determine the starting point for your design. Count the number of stitches you'll need to make in each color, and work your way through the pattern one section at a time. Remember to always bring your needle up from the back of the fabric, and back down through the front.</p>
