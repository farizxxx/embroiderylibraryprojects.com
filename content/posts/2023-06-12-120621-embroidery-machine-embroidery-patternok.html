<p>Embroidery has been an essential craft for centuries. It is an excellent way to personalize clothing and accessories. Machine embroidery has added a new dimension to the art of embroidery. In this article, we will take a closer look at machine embroidery and some popular machine embroidery patterns.</p>

<h2>What is Machine Embroidery?</h2>
<p>Machine embroidery is the process of using a sewing machine to create designs on fabric or other materials. Machine embroidery uses a digitized design file that tells the machine where to place the stitches. The machine then follows the instructions to create the design. The digitized design file can be created by the user or downloaded from the internet. </p>

<h2>Types of Machine Embroidery</h2>
<p>There are two types of machine embroidery: free-motion embroidery and computerized machine embroidery. Free-motion embroidery involves manually moving the fabric under the needle to create the design. Computerized machine embroidery uses a computer to control the stitching and creates more precise and intricate designs.</p>

<h2>Popular Machine Embroidery Designs</h2>
