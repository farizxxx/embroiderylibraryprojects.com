<h2>Star Wars Cross Stitch Pattern Designs</h2>

<p>The great thing about Star Wars cross stitch patterns is that there are so many different designs to choose from.

<p>If you're looking for something a bit more complex, you could try a pattern featuring multiple characters. For example, there are patterns out there that show the entire cast of the original trilogy, as well as patterns that focus specifically on the droids, like R2-D2 and C-3PO.</p>
