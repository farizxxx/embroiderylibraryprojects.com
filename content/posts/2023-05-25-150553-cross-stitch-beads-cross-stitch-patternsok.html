<h2>What is beaded cross stitch?</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the patterns, let's take a moment to understand what beaded cross stitch is. Essentially, beaded cross stitch involves adding beads to your cross stitch design in order to create texture, sparkle, and dimension. Simply put, it's a way of taking your stitching to the next level!</p>

<p>To add beads to your cross stitch, you'll need a few key materials. First, you'll need beads! There are many different types of beads available, including seed beads, pony beads, and Delica beads. You'll also need a beading needle, which is thinner and longer than a regular cross stitch needle. Finally, you'll need a good pair of scissors and some strong thread.</p>

<h2>How to add beads to your cross stitch</h2>

<p>Adding beads to your cross stitch is a fairly simple process, but it does require some patience and practice. Here's a basic rundown of the steps:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Thread your needle</h3>

<p>Start by threading your beading needle with a length of thread. You may want to use a doubled length of thread for added strength.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Pick up a bead</h3>

<p>Using your beading needle, pick up a single bead and slide it down to the bottom of your thread. Be sure to leave a tail of thread at the bottom for later.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cross stitch as normal</h3>

<p>Now it's time to cross stitch as normal! Simply stitch your design following your pattern, making sure to leave a gap where you want to add a bead.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the bead</h3>

<p>When you reach the gap, use your beading needle to pick up the bead and slide it down the thread until it sits snugly against the fabric. Then, continue stitching as normal.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Secure the bead</h3>

<p>Once you've finished stitching, tie off your thread at the back of the fabric and secure the bead by stitching through it a few times.</p>
