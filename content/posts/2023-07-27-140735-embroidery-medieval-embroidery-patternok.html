<h2>The History of Medieval Embroidery</h2>

<p>Embroidery has been around for thousands of years, but it wasn't until the Middle Ages that it became an art form in its own right.

<p>Medieval embroidery patterns were influenced by a variety of sources, including Islamic art, Byzantine art, and Celtic art.
